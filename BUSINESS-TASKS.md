# Business Accounts Implementation Tasks

## Overview

This document breaks down all implementation tasks required to transform the business dashboard into the comprehensive business accounts system outlined in `BUSINESS_ACCOUNTS_VISION.md`. Tasks are organized by functional area and prioritized for development.

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT**: Many features in this business system will connect to a future admin system. Tasks marked with `[ADMIN-CONNECTED]` require careful implementation as they will be used in production when the admin system is created.

## Priority Levels

- **P0 (Critical)**: Core functionality, must be completed first
- **P1 (High)**: Important features, complete after P0
- **P2 (Medium)**: Enhancement features, complete after P1  
- **P3 (Low)**: Nice-to-have features, complete if time permits
