# Playwright MCP Integration Test

This file contains instructions to test the Playwright MCP server integration with Claude Code.

## Setup Status

✅ **Playwright MCP Server Installed**: `@playwright/mcp@0.0.37`
✅ **MCP Configuration Added**: Server added to Claude Code configuration
✅ **Server Validated**: Command-line help confirms server is functional

## Testing the Integration

After restarting Claude Code, you can test the Playwright MCP integration using these approaches:

### 1. Check MCP Server Status
Run `/mcp` command in Claude Code to verify the Playwright server is connected.

### 2. Basic Web Automation Test
Ask Claude to perform basic web interactions:
- Navigate to a website
- Take a screenshot
- Find elements on the page
- Fill out forms
- Click buttons

### 3. Advanced Testing Scenarios
- Test the AI feedback platform's customer PWA interface
- Automate business dashboard interactions
- Validate form submissions and workflows

### 4. Example Commands to Test

```bash
# Example interactions you can ask Claude to perform:
"Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and take a screenshot"
"Go to the business dashboard and check if the login form is working"
"Test the voice feedback flow on the customer PWA"
```

## Expected Capabilities

The Playwright MCP server provides these tools to Claude:
- Browser automation (Chrome, Firefox, Safari/WebKit, Edge)
