# iOS Safari Compatibility Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive manual testing procedures for validating iOS Safari compatibility of the AI Feedback Platform PWA.

## Pre-Testing Setup

### Required Devices
- **iPhone 15 Pro** (iOS 17+)
- **iPhone 14** (iOS 16+) 
- **iPhone 13** (iOS 15+)
- **iPad Pro** (latest iOS)
- **iPad Air** (latest iOS)

### Environment Setup
1. Ensure development servers are running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:web    # Customer PWA on http://localhost:3000
   npm run dev:api    # API Gateway on http://localhost:3001  
   npm run dev:business # Business Dashboard on http://localhost:3001
   ```

2. Enable network access from mobile devices:
   - Connect devices to same WiFi network
   - Use computer's IP address instead of localhost
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:3000`

### Browser Settings
1. **Safari Settings**:
   - Enable JavaScript
   - Allow camera and microphone access
   - Clear cache and data before testing

2. **iOS Settings**:
   - Settings > Safari > Advanced > Web Inspector (ON)
   - Settings > Privacy & Security > Camera (Allow for Safari)
   - Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone (Allow for Safari)

   - [ ] Viewport adjusts when keyboard appears
   - [ ] Form fields remain visible above keyboard
   - [ ] Keyboard dismisses properly

**Expected Results:**
- Touch interactions feel native
- Layout adapts to orientation changes
- Keyboard behavior doesn't break UI

### ✅ 5. Performance & Resource Usage

#### Test Steps:
1. **Page Load Performance**
   - [ ] Measure initial page load time
   - [ ] Should be < 3 seconds on 4G connection

   - [ ] Battery drain should be minimal
   - [ ] Device should not overheat

**Expected Results:**
- Fast loading and responsive performance
- Memory usage remains stable
- Minimal battery impact

### ✅ 6. Error Handling & Edge Cases

#### Test Steps:
1. **Network Interruption**
   - [ ] Start recording
   - [ ] Disable WiFi during recording
   - [ ] Recording continues locally
   - [ ] Appropriate network error message
   - [ ] Re-enable network
   - [ ] Data syncs when connection restored

2. **App Backgrounding**
   - [ ] Start recording
   - [ ] Switch to another app
   - [ ] Return to PWA
   - [ ] Recording state preserved OR gracefully stopped
   - [ ] No crashes or data loss

3. **Low Storage**
   - [ ] Test with minimal available storage

2. **Data Transmission**
   - [ ] Audio chunks transmit during recording
   - [ ] Messages received from server
