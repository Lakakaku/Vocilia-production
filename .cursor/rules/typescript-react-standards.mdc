### TypeScript and React Standards

- Imports order: React/Next → external libs → shared packages → relative modules. See examples in [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md).
- Use explicit types for function signatures and exported APIs; avoid `any`.
- Prefer meaningful names: avoid 1–2 character identifiers; capture intent.
- Control flow: early returns, handle edge cases first, avoid deep nesting.
- Errors: never swallow errors; use structured error responses where applicable.
- Comments: only for complex logic; explain "why"; no inline noise.
- Formatting: match existing style; wrap long lines; avoid unrelated reformatting.
- Testing: for new logic, colocate `*.test.ts(x)` with ≥80% coverage for core logic.
- Security: sanitize inputs and validate with schemas where appropriate.
