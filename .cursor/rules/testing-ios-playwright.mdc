### iOS Safari Testing Guidelines

- Global setup: [tests/ios-safari/global-setup.js](mdc:tests/ios-safari/global-setup.js)
- Expect servers available locally:
  - PWA at http://localhost:3000
  - API at http://localhost:3001
  - WebSocket at ws://localhost:3001
- Pre-warm connectivity and write env info under `test-results/ios-safari`.

Conventions
- Use `data-testid` where selectors are brittle.
- Prefer timeouts tuned for mobile devices.
- Ensure WebSocket fallback behavior is covered when connection fails.
