### Security & Compliance Guardrails

- Follow GDPR defaults: minimize data, no voice storage, 90-day retention.
- Validate and sanitize all inputs; enforce rate limits per [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md).
- Prefer structured error responses; never leak stack traces to clients.
- Keep performance targets in mind: voice <2s, API <500ms, PWA <3s.
- When editing auth, payments, or PII handling, document changes in [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md) and `docs/`.
