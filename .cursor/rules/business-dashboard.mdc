### Business Dashboard Guidelines

- App Router root: [apps/business-dashboard/src/app/layout.tsx](mdc:apps/business-dashboard/src/app/layout.tsx)
- Main page: [apps/business-dashboard/src/app/page.tsx](mdc:apps/business-dashboard/src/app/page.tsx)
- Auth pages: [apps/business-dashboard/src/app/login/page.tsx](mdc:apps/business-dashboard/src/app/login/page.tsx)
- Feedback view: [apps/business-dashboard/src/app/feedback/page.tsx](mdc:apps/business-dashboard/src/app/feedback/page.tsx)
- Components: [apps/business-dashboard/src/components](mdc:apps/business-dashboard/src/components)

Conventions
- Keep UI responsive and mobile-friendly; prioritize readability of insights.
- Use components under `components/dashboard` and `components/feedback` for composition.
- Protect pages with `auth/ProtectedRoute` and `auth/AuthProvider` where needed.
- Follow Tailwind class conventions in `globals.css`; avoid inline styles.
- Add client/server boundaries explicitly ("use client") when needed.
