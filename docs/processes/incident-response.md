## Incident Response Overview

### Definition and Scope

**Incident Definition:**
Any unplanned event that disrupts normal operations, compromises security, or negatively impacts customers, businesses, or platform operations.

**Response Philosophy:**
- **Safety First:** Protect customer data and platform security above all
- **Rapid Response:** Minimize impact through quick identification and response
- **Clear Communication:** Keep all stakeholders informed throughout the incident
- **Learn and Improve:** Use every incident to strengthen our systems and processes

### Incident Response Objectives

**Primary Objectives:**
```yaml
containment: "Limit the scope and impact of the incident"
eradication: "Remove the root cause of the incident"
recovery: "Restore normal operations safely"
communication: "Keep stakeholders informed throughout"
improvement: "Learn from the incident to prevent recurrence"
```

### Success Metrics

**Response Time Targets:**
```yaml
critical_incidents:
  detection_to_response: "< 15 minutes"
  response_to_containment: "< 30 minutes"
  containment_to_resolution: "< 4 hours"
  
high_priority_incidents:
  detection_to_response: "< 30 minutes"
  response_to_containment: "< 1 hour"
  containment_to_resolution: "< 12 hours"
  
medium_priority_incidents:
  detection_to_response: "< 2 hours"
