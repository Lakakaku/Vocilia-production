## Business Management

### Business Onboarding Process 🏢

**Application Review Workflow:**

1. **Automatic Validation** (2-5 minutes)
   ```
   ✅ Organization number validation (Bolagsverket API)
   ✅ Address verification (Sweden Post)
   ✅ Basic fraud screening (blacklists)
   ✅ Document format validation
   ```

2. **Manual Review** (24-48 hours)
   ```
   📋 Business legitimacy assessment
   📋 Document authenticity check
   📋 Risk assessment scoring
   📋 Compliance verification
   ```

3. **Approval/Rejection Decision**
   ```
   ✅ APPROVE: Send onboarding email, create Stripe account
   ❌ REJECT: Send explanation, allow reapplication
   ⏸️ PENDING: Request additional documentation
   ```

**Business Approval Dashboard:**
- Pending applications queue
- Review priority scoring
- Approval/rejection statistics
- Average processing times
- Escalation alerts

### Business Account Management 💼

**Account Status Management:**
```
ACTIVE ✅
- Normal operations
- All features available
- Regular monitoring

TRIAL 🆓
- 30-day trial period
- Limited features
- Conversion tracking

SUSPENDED ⏸️
- Temporary suspension
- Reason documented
- Reactivation process

TERMINATED ❌
- Permanent closure
- Final billing
- Data retention compliance
```

**Business Operations Monitoring:**
- Feedback volume trends
- Quality score patterns
- Commission payment status
- POS integration health
- Customer complaint rates

**Key Business Metrics:**
```sql
-- Monthly business performance summary
SELECT 
    b.name,
    COUNT(fs.id) as feedback_count,
    AVG(fs.quality_score) as avg_quality,
    SUM(fs.reward_amount) as total_rewards,
    SUM(fs.reward_amount * 0.20) as commission_due
FROM businesses b
JOIN feedback_sessions fs ON b.id = fs.business_id
WHERE fs.created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY b.id, b.name
ORDER BY total_rewards DESC;
```

### POS Integration Management ⚙️

**Supported POS Systems:**
- **Square:** Real-time webhook integration
- **Shopify POS:** API-based transaction sync  
- **Zettle (PayPal):** OAuth connection
- **Manual:** Receipt-based verification

**Integration Status Monitoring:**
```json
{
  "square_integrations": {
    "total": 89,
    "healthy": 84,
    "warning": 3,
    "error": 2
  },
  "sync_performance": {
    "average_latency": "1.2s",
    "success_rate": "99.1%",
    "last_24h_transactions": 2847
  }
}
```

**Common Integration Issues:**
1. **OAuth Token Expiration:** Auto-refresh with fallback alerts
2. **Webhook Failures:** Retry mechanism + manual sync option
3. **Rate Limiting:** Queue management + throttling controls
4. **Data Inconsistencies:** Validation rules + error logging

## Fraud Detection & Prevention

### Fraud Detection Dashboard 🚨

**Real-Time Fraud Monitoring:**
```
🔴 HIGH RISK (Score > 0.8): 3 active cases
🟡 MEDIUM RISK (Score 0.5-0.8): 12 flagged sessions  
🟢 LOW RISK (Score < 0.5): 1,232 normal sessions
📊 Detection Rate: 0.3% (Target: <2%)
💰 Prevented Loss: 1,247 SEK (last 7 days)
```

**Fraud Detection Components:**

1. **Voice Authenticity Analysis:**
   ```python
   def analyze_voice_authenticity(transcript, business_context):
       scores = {
           'content_specificity': check_specific_details(transcript),
           'business_context_match': validate_context(transcript, business_context),
           'linguistic_patterns': analyze_language_patterns(transcript),
           'temporal_consistency': check_timing_patterns(transcript)
       }
       return calculate_authenticity_score(scores)
   ```

2. **Device Fingerprinting:**
   ```json
   {
     "fingerprint_id": "fp_abc123def456",
     "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
     "screen_resolution": "375x812",
     "timezone": "Europe/Stockholm",
     "language": "sv-SE",
     "webgl_renderer": "Apple GPU",
     "risk_factors": [
       "multiple_sessions_same_device",
       "geographic_inconsistency"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
   ```sql
   -- Detect suspicious customer patterns
   SELECT 
       customer_hash,
       COUNT(*) as session_count,
       AVG(quality_score) as avg_score,
       STDDEV(quality_score) as score_variance,
       STRING_AGG(DISTINCT business_id::text, ',') as businesses
   FROM feedback_sessions 
   WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
   GROUP BY customer_hash
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 10 OR AVG(quality_score) > 90;
   ```

### Fraud Investigation Workflow 🔍

**Investigation Process:**

1. **Alert Triage** (< 5 minutes)
   - Review automated fraud flags
   - Priority scoring (financial impact × confidence)
   - Assign to investigation queue

2. **Evidence Gathering** (15-30 minutes)
   ```
   📋 Session Details Analysis
   - Transcript review and context validation
   - Device fingerprint examination
   - Geographic and temporal patterns
   
   📋 Historical Pattern Analysis  
   - Customer behavior history
   - Similar fraud case comparison
   - Business relationship verification
   
   📋 Technical Evidence Collection
   - API request logs and headers
   - Payment processing records
   - Cross-reference with known fraud patterns
   ```

3. **Decision Making** (5-10 minutes)
   ```
   ✅ FALSE POSITIVE: Release funds, update ML model
   🔴 CONFIRMED FRAUD: Block payment, flag customer
   ⏸️ NEEDS REVIEW: Escalate to senior investigator
   ```

**Fraud Response Actions:**
- Immediate payment hold
- Customer account flagging
- Business notification (if needed)
- Law enforcement referral (serious cases)
- ML model training data update

### Advanced Fraud Prevention 🛡️

**Machine Learning Models:**
```python
class FraudDetectionML:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = {
            'authenticity_classifier': load_model('authenticity_v2.pkl'),
            'pattern_detector': load_model('patterns_v1.pkl'),
            'risk_scorer': load_model('risk_assessment_v3.pkl')
        }
    
    def predict_fraud_risk(self, session_data):
        features = self.extract_features(session_data)
        
        auth_score = self.models['authenticity_classifier'].predict(features['text'])
        pattern_risk = self.models['pattern_detector'].predict(features['behavioral'])
        overall_risk = self.models['risk_scorer'].predict(features['combined'])
        
        return {
            'fraud_probability': overall_risk[0],
            'confidence': calculate_confidence(auth_score, pattern_risk),
            'risk_factors': identify_risk_factors(features)
        }
```

**Geographic Validation:**
```sql
-- Validate customer location consistency
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_geographic_consistency(
    customer_hash VARCHAR,
    business_location GEOGRAPHY,
    device_timezone VARCHAR
) RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
DECLARE
    recent_locations GEOGRAPHY[];
    distance_threshold FLOAT := 100000; -- 100km
BEGIN
    -- Get recent session locations for this customer
    SELECT ARRAY_AGG(bl.location) INTO recent_locations
    FROM feedback_sessions fs
    JOIN business_locations bl ON fs.location_id = bl.id
    WHERE fs.customer_hash = customer_hash
    AND fs.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
    
    -- Check if new location is consistent with pattern
    IF array_length(recent_locations, 1) > 5 THEN
        RETURN check_location_pattern(recent_locations, business_location);
    END IF;
    
    RETURN TRUE; -- Insufficient data for validation
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
