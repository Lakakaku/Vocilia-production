### 3. Verify Your Purchase üßæ

To prevent fraud, you'll need to verify a recent purchase:

## Maximizing Your Earnings

### Best Practices for High-Quality Feedback üìà

**üéØ Focus on Specifics**
```
Instead of: "Maten var god"
Say: "Laxen var perfekt grillad och serverades med f√§rska gr√∂nsaker. Bearnaises√•sen hade en fin konsistens och smakade hemgjord."
```

**üéØ Mention Staff Members**
```
"Servit√∂ren Marcus var mycket professionell och kunnig om vinstocken. Han rekommenderade ett perfekt vin till min fisk."
```

**üéØ Provide Constructive Criticism**
```
"K√∂n var l√•ng vid lunchtid, men kanske kunde en extra kass√∂r hj√§lpa till. Maten var v√§rt v√§ntan dock."
```

**üéØ Include Atmosphere and Experience**
```
"Lokalen hade mysig belysning och lagom musik f√∂r samtal. Perfekt f√∂r en date eller aff√§rsmiddag."
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid ‚ùå

**Generic Comments:**
- "Bra service" ‚Üí Be specific about what made it good
- "Okej mat" ‚Üí Describe taste, presentation, temperature
- "Mysig st√§mning" ‚Üí Explain what created that feeling

**Too Brief:**
- Aim for 30-60 seconds of speaking
- Cover multiple aspects of your experience
- Share both positives and areas for improvement

**Dishonest Feedback:**
- The AI can detect fake or exaggerated reviews
- Only review places you actually visited
- Be honest about your experience
