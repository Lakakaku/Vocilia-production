## FAQ

### Q: What if a transaction is exactly 2.5 minutes outside the window?

A: **Yes.** Compare the total amount the customer paid including all taxes and fees.

### Q: What if I find multiple transactions that could match?
A: **Verify it.** If any transaction within the time/amount window matches, mark as verified.

### Q: Customer says they paid cash but I only see card transactions?
A: **Check carefully.** Verify all payment methods. If no match found, reject.
