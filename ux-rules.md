# UX Rules: Sound Wave Nordic

## Core UX Principles

### 1. Voice-First Experience
- **Audio is Primary**: All interactions should prioritize voice input over text
- **Visual Feedback**: Provide immediate visual confirmation of audio detection
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Text alternatives for accessibility, never the primary path
- **Context Awareness**: Interface adapts based on audio state (recording, processing, complete)

### 2. Listening-Centered Design
- **Active Listening Metaphors**: Use visual cues that suggest the system is "hearing"
- **Sound Visualization**: Real-time feedback during voice input (waveforms, ripples)
- **Respectful Attention**: Interface suggests focused listening, not distraction
- **Breathing Room**: Generous spacing that allows for audio processing time

### 3. Swedish Simplicity
- **Minimal Cognitive Load**: One primary action per screen
- **Clean Information Hierarchy**: Clear priority without clutter
- **Functional Beauty**: Every element serves a purpose
- **Trustworthy Transparency**: Clear about what's happening and why

## Interaction Patterns

### Voice Recording States
```
Idle State → Visual cue to start speaking
Recording State → Live audio visualization + gentle pulse
Processing State → Wave animation suggesting AI "listening"
Complete State → Confirmation with quality feedback
```

### Touch Interactions
- **Primary Actions**: Large circular buttons (48px+ touch target)
- **Secondary Actions**: Smaller rounded rectangles
- **Gestures**: Minimal - tap and scroll only
- **Feedback**: Ripple animations on all touch interactions

### Navigation Philosophy
- **Minimal Navigation**: Voice flow should be linear and focused
- **Clear Exit Points**: Always provide way back without losing progress
- **Progress Indication**: Show where user is in the feedback journey
- **Context Switching**: Smooth transitions between voice and review states

## Accessibility Standards

### Audio Accessibility
- **Visual Audio Cues**: Waveform visualization for hearing-impaired users
- **Vibration Feedback**: Haptic feedback on mobile for audio state changes
- **Text Alternatives**: Full text-based fallback workflow
- **Volume Controls**: User control over playback levels

### Visual Accessibility  
- **High Contrast Mode**: All colors meet WCAG AA standards
- **Scalable Text**: Support for 200% zoom without horizontal scrolling
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear keyboard navigation paths
- **Screen Reader**: Semantic HTML with proper ARIA labels

### Cognitive Accessibility
- **Single Task Focus**: One primary action visible at a time
- **Clear Language**: Simple, direct instructions
- **Error Prevention**: Validate inputs before processing
- **Recovery Paths**: Easy way to restart or go back

## Mobile-First Considerations

### Touch Targets
- **Minimum Size**: 44px × 44px (iOS HIG standard)
- **Comfortable Spacing**: 8px minimum between interactive elements
- **Thumb-Friendly**: Primary actions in comfortable reach zones
- **Edge Avoidance**: Critical actions away from screen edges

### Performance
- **Loading States**: Show immediate feedback, process in background
- **Offline Capability**: Core PWA functions work without internet
- **Battery Optimization**: Minimize continuous audio processing
- **Data Efficiency**: Compress audio before transmission

### Platform Integration
- **iOS Safari**: Optimized for WebKit, handle permission flows
- **Android Chrome**: Material Design influences where appropriate
- **PWA Features**: Add to home screen, notifications, app-like feel

## Feedback & Reward Psychology

### Positive Reinforcement
- **Immediate Feedback**: Show recording quality in real-time
- **Progress Celebration**: Animate quality scores and rewards
- **Achievement Recognition**: Acknowledge improvement over time
- **Social Proof**: Subtle indicators of community participation

### Trust Building
- **Transparent Scoring**: Explain why feedback received specific quality score
- **Privacy Assurance**: Clear about what's stored vs. processed
- **Fair Rewards**: Consistent reward calculations, no "gotchas"
- **Human Touch**: Personality in AI responses, not robotic

## Error Handling Philosophy

### Graceful Degradation
- **Audio Failures**: Fall back to text with explanation
- **Network Issues**: Queue feedback for later transmission
- **Permission Denied**: Clear explanation and alternative paths
- **Quality Issues**: Gentle guidance for improvement, not rejection

### Error Communication
- **Human Language**: "Something went wrong" not "Error 500"
- **Actionable Solutions**: Tell user exactly what to do next
- **Emotional Tone**: Apologetic and helpful, never blaming
- **Recovery Focus**: How to fix, not what broke

## Business Dashboard UX

### Professional Efficiency
- **Scan-able Information**: Key metrics visible without scrolling
- **Drill-down Pattern**: Summary → Details → Individual feedback
- **Bulk Actions**: Handle multiple feedback items efficiently
- **Export Capabilities**: Easy data extraction for external analysis

### Insight Discovery
- **Visual Data Stories**: Charts that reveal trends and patterns
- **Smart Filtering**: Find specific feedback types quickly
- **Comparative Views**: Period-over-period, location-based comparisons
- **Actionable Recommendations**: AI suggests areas for improvement

### Multi-location Support
- **Location Switching**: Easy navigation between stores/locations
- **Aggregated Views**: See combined performance across locations
- **Role-based Access**: Different views for managers vs. staff
- **White-label Ready**: Customizable branding for enterprise clients

## Measurement & Success Metrics

### User Experience KPIs
- **Completion Rate**: % of started feedback sessions completed
- **Average Session Time**: Time from QR scan to reward confirmation
- **Retry Rate**: How often users need to re-record
- **Return Usage**: Customer using system multiple times

### Business Value Metrics
- **Feedback Quality**: Average quality scores over time
- **Actionable Insights**: % of feedback that leads to business action
- **Customer Engagement**: Length and depth of voice feedback
- **Business Adoption**: Active usage by business accounts
